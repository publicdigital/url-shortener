# Public Digital URL shortener

Public Digital wants to provide a URL shortening service
without requiring our users to use services that soak up
lots of their data.

Since there doesn't appear to be a SaaS offering that
guarantees privacy, and we want to run as little software
as possible we have set up an amazon s3 based redirect
service.

If you know of a SaaS service that we could rely on,
please let us know!

## Infrastructure configuration

We use:

* AWS Route53 for DNS
* AWS CertificateManager to make it all work using https
* AWS CloudFront for caching and routing
* AWS S3 for hosting the redirects

This is all configured using terraform, other than the certificate
creation process that needs to be done via the AWS Console.

We keep our configuration in a file called conf.tfvars which looks
like:

```
site_domain = "pdlink.co"
certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:our-aws-certificate-details"
```

For more on managing terraform variables see: https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html

To set things up or make updates we call:

```
terraform apply -var-file=conf.tfvars
```

This assumes that you have a ~/.aws/config file with the right
credentials in it. Read this if you need more info on authenticating to AWS:

## Setting up the redirections

The redirections are managed as a CSV file. To create a new redirect,
add it to the file `build-short-urls/pd-short-urls.csv`

There are then two options for deployment:

### Deploy from the command line

Run:

```
cd build-short-urls
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_key> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret> python build_redirects.py
```

This assumes you are:

* running python3
* have the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file

###Â Use github actions

The preferred way to do deployments is using github actions. For that to work your
repository will need secrets set up for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

With that done, pushing the updated CSV to github (or just updating it using github
on the web) will trigger a deployment.
